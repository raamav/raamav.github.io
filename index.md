I am Rama, and I am a Data Scientist from Mumbai, India. I have created this page to list out some of the research projects which I have recently worked on. Most of these projects are in NLP and Computer Vision. 

### Natural Language Processing

Worked on projects on Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis.

1. **"Real or NOT" : NLP to Identify Public Emergency Related Tweets** [[code](https://github.com/raamav/Text-Classification/blob/master/README.md)] : Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. Its vital to be able to identify the Tweets that are about real Emergencies. However, itâ€™s not always easy to do so.
   * **Data**: The dataset comprises 7500+ tweets which cover a wide set of public emergencies like Natural Disasters
   * **Approach**: Used a neural net with Bi-Directional LSTMs to extract the sentiment
   * **Results**: The best performing model had an accuracy of 83% on the test set

2. **Sentiment Analysis on Full-Length Movie Reviews (IMDB)** [[code](https://github.com/raamav/Sentiment-Analysis-UserReviews/blob/master/IMDB_Reviews_DeepLearning_(v2).ipynb)] : IMDB Reviews is one of the best known publically available datasets for sentiment analysis. The reviews in the dataset are selected across movies and genre.
   * **Data**: The dataset comprises 50,000 'full-length' reviews. Most of these reviews are several paragraphs long
   * **Approach**: 
        * From an architectural standpoint, used a three layer Bidirectional LSTM network followed by a set of three Dense layers. Incorporated recurrent dropouts which greatly improved the validation accuracy
        * Used Pre-Trained Word Embeddings to further improve the classification accuracy. Used the 100 dimensional GloVe embedding as an input to the deep network
        * Emoployed some innoative approaches of text-preprocessing, expanding out word contractions *(don't -> do not)* and possessives *(people's -> people s)* which  
   * **Results**: The best performing model had an accuracy of 86% on the test set
