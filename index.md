I am Rama, and I am a Data Scientist from Mumbai, India. I have created this page to list out some of the research projects which I have recently worked on. Most of these projects are in NLP and Computer Vision. 

### Natural Language Processing

**"Real or NOT" : NLP to Identify Public Emergency Related Tweets** [[code](https://github.com/raamav/Text-Classification/blob/master/README.md)]
> Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies)

Being able to predict which Tweets are about real Public Emergencies (*eg Earthquakes, Floods, Terrorist Events*) is therefore, of vital importance. Hopwever, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

In this project, I have tried out two variants of LSTM based approaches - one with pretrained embeddings and one without. The model which incorporate pre-trained embeddings from the Glove model had an accuracy of 83% on the test set.

I have also created a set of helper functions for data preprocessing, vocabulary building and creating embedding matrix from pre-trained embeddings.

The best performing model had an accuracy of 83% on the test data


### Computer Vision

Worked on projects on Image Classification and Image Color Segmentation.
