I am Rama, and I am a Data Scientist from Mumbai, India. I have created this page to list out some of the research projects which I have recently worked on. Most of these projects are in NLP and Computer Vision. 

### Natural Language Processing

Worked on projects on Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis.

1. **"Real or NOT" : NLP to Identify Public Emergency Related Tweets** [[code](https://github.com/raamav/Text-Classification/blob/master/README.md)] : Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. Its vital to be able to identify the Tweets that are about real Emergencies. However, itâ€™s not always easy to do so.
  * **Data**: The dataset comprises 7500+ tweets which cover a wide set of public emergencies like Natural Disasters
  * **Approach**: Used a neural net with Bi-directional LSTMs to extract the sentiment
  * **Results**: The best performing model had an accuracy of 83% on the test set




### Computer Vision

Worked on projects on Image Classification and Image Color Segmentation.
